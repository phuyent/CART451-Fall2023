      Weekly Reading Question: Imagine you go back in time to the 1970s
      to change the history of the internet to your own liking.
      Based on the events described in the reading, how would you do it?
      How much funding would you need to achieve the changes you seek?
      Where do you get that funding from at the time, and how difficult is it to obtain?
      What does your answer to these questions say about the 'great man theory' of history?.

      -> Answer: Currently the Internet is functioning fairly acceptable. However, if I could go back,
      I would make sure that people would not forget the Internet's origin. I want the world to keep in mind how far we have come
      and how will we proceed to optimize this tool called the Internet. People took it for granted these days and that creates an ignorant attitude towards what the Internet is capable of.
      In addition, I would make sure students at that time can have access to the Internet, it is interesting to see what they could do with the new, potential piece of technology. As for the funding,
      I believe that universities and the gorvernment itself would gladly pay half of the funding needed (maybe around 5,000 dollars at that time should cover it).

      <br>-> Answer: The 'Great Man Theory' of history claims that history can mostly be explained with the involvement of great men
      who contributed largely throughout centuries. Certainly, they should be credited for their work, yet this theory is empasized more on the sex of the individual, less than the work. <br>
